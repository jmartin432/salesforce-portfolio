# Salesforce Portfolio

I am just getting started in the Salesforce Ecosystem. I made this page to start getting familiar with Lightning Web Components
and as a personal porfolio manager.

The back-end is controlled by custom objects and the front-end is all managed by Lightning Web Components.

Thank you for checking it out.
